<ol>
  <li><h3>Indian 2</h3></li>
  <p>
    It is the next sequel of Indian, where the old man is back after 28 years.
  </p>
  <li><h3>Maharaja</h3></li>
  <p>
    This story conveys that even the morally-right get easily corrupted as they
    face ordinary humans in their most perverse form.
  </p>
  <li><h3>Kalki 2898 AD</h3></li>
  <p>
    It is about the modern avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, is said to have
